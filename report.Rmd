```

## Resume Analysis

```{r}


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Word Cloud for Topic 1
lda_skills %>%
  filter(topic == 1) %>%
  with(wordcloud(term, beta, max.words = 50))

# Teamlead

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Word Cloud for Topic 2
lda_skills %>%
  filter(topic == 2) %>%
  with(wordcloud(term, beta, max.words = 50))

# Financial

```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Word Cloud for Topic 3
lda_skills %>%
  filter(topic == 3) %>%
  with(wordcloud(term, beta, max.words = 50))

# Techniqual engineer

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
